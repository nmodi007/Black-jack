# Black-jack
Have you ever wondered what would happen in the long run if you play Blackjack at a casino "by the Blackjack chart/table"? In this project I simulate playing blackjack at a casino to find out the expected value of dealer wins and other stats. 


## How to use this program:
From the terminal: 

- `python3 sim_blackjack.py rounds players`
  
  - rounds: number of rounds to simulate.
  - players: number of players at the table.

 ## Outputs:
  - dealer_stats.png --> a pie chart that shows dealer's      winning %, losing %, and pushes %.
  - players_balance.png --> line-graph that shows how each player's balance changes over time/hands.
  - stats --> each player's winning %, losing %, and pushes %. The last item in this file is the dealer's stats.
  player[#] --> results of every signle hand played by that player. # is a digit (i.e player2)

## How the dealer plays
  - 17 or above, the dealer must stand.
  - 16 or below, the dealer must keep hitting until the dealer is at or above 17.
  - If dealer has an ace and counting it as 11 puts the dealer at or above 17 then the dealer must stand.
  
## How the players play
  - players use two charts: The hit_stay_or_double.csv chart and the splitting.csv chart.

  - The hit_stay_or_double chart takes two inputs: the player total and the dealer face-up-card, and returns either hit, stay, or double.

  - the splitting chart is used when the player is dealt a pair as the original hand. The pair and the dealer face-up-card is the input and output is either split or continue playing.
  
- Blackjack charts tell the players exactly what to do for every possible scenario.

- Only players can split. Example, players is dealt a pair of 8s. Player splits. Then the player is dealt another 8. He will split that pair again. Now a player has 3 hands and the game continues.

## Results
After running the simulation a dealers-stats-pie-chart is created. I am getting the following results:
- dealer wins about 48% of the time.
- dealer loses about 43% of the time.
- dealer pushes about 8% of the time.

- players_balance.png is created at the end as well. This shows how each player's balance changes thru-out. How the winning/losing happens over time. I was thinking that if the deck favors the dealer or if the deck favors the players then I would see all the players losing/winning together. I donâ€™t see this trend.

## Other info
- Each player bets $10 for each hand.
If a player gets a natural Blackjack, then the dealer pays 1.5 times the bet, so $15.

- My findings are contrary to what I hear about some only 0.5% house-advantage if you play by the chart. My simulation shows a 5% advantage to the house. 

- Six decks are used in the tray. cards are shuffled and then the deck is cut.
